        <h3 class="my id">Rules</h3>
        <p>The objective of Boggle is to find as many valid words as possible within the 3 minute time limit. </p>

        <h3 class="myid">Gameplay</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Words are formed by connecting adjacent letters (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in any
                direction to create a sequence of letters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each word must be composed of at least three letters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Players can only use a letter square once for each word found. For example, to find the word "apple,"
                there would need to be 2 letter P squares on the board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proper nouns, abbreviations, contractions, and hyphenated words are typically not allowed. Only valid
                English words found in a standard dictionary are accepted.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="myid">Scoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unlike the conventional Boggle scoring system, the scoring system employed in this game is based on the
                letters included in the words you find and is as follows:
            </li>
            <li>
                Letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'L', 'N', 'S', 'T', 'R' are worth 1 point
            </li>
            <li>
                Letters 'D' and 'G' are worth 2 points
            </li>
            <li>
                Letters 'B', 'C', 'M' and 'P' are worth 3 points
            </li>
            <li>
                Letters 'F', 'H', 'V', 'W' and 'Y' are worth 4 points
            </li>
            <li>
                The letter 'K' is worth 5 points
            </li>
            <li>
                Letters 'J' and 'X' are worth 8 points
            </li>
            <li>
                Letters 'Q' and 'Z' are worth 10 points
            </li>
        </ul>
